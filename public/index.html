          <h3>Why Diogeno?</h3>
          <p>Diogeno is Esperanto for the Greek philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, one of the founders of Cynic philosophy and in our sense one of the most self-ruling and bright minds that ever lived. He was a controversial figure and among many other things, he declared himself a cosmopolitan and a citizen of the world rather than claiming allegiance to just one place. Diogenes didn’t need much to be happy as he’s often pictured as living in an old barrel and having very few possessions.</p>
